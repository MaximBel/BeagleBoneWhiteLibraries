# BeagleBoneWhiteLibraries
This repository is intended to collect C++ libraries for BB White, reworked from BBB libraries.

Toolchain: GCC Linaro 4.9.4.

I will be updated list of available high-level peripheral libraries for BB white every time, when I finish its reworking. Now available next libraries:
-GPIO(test);
-UART(test);
-PWM(test).
